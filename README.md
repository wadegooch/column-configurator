## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Debugging with Visual Studio Code

The .vscode folder has been included for demonstration purposes. After dependencies have been installed and the application has been started with `npm start`, the included debug configuration named 'Chrome' can be run from the Visual Studio Debug tools. A browser will attach to the locally running application to debug in Visual Studio Code.
